*** Timestamps refer to the moment an \n arrives and is printed after it, hence on a new line. All following chars are printed after it, but it doesn't update. but should represent timestamp of last character, then a placeholder for the timestamp must be inserted, and kept that way until "\n" is encountered, after which the timestamp is nachtr채glich inserted. A simpler way would be to buffer the text until "\n" is encountered (one new line would have to be added/removed once timestamps is un-/checked).
*   If each line is printed in TextBox explicitly using innate line numbers or when using multiple textboxes, it becomes easy later to remodify them and insert timestamps nachtr채glich, while also optionally r-justifying them. It may even be so possible without explicit line numbers, simply by splitting/joining the full text based on "\n" chars (if repr was used, all "\\n" substrings would have to be replaced by "\n" first, but if nachtr채glich, it requires tagging where repr starts and ends). Then the timestamps representing the last character can be nachtr채glich inserted without buffering. They can then also continuously update.
