* It seems MPY occasionally sends out a move cursor escape sequence (\x1b[*D) while omitting the "[" or misplacing it one or more positions afterwards (even after subsequent non-escape sequences), causing the regex to fail.
* binding two communic+ating endpoints to the same port number doesn't work if the address is localhost/loopback. So medium.py has to be remodified to use udp.connect() for the connector. This isn't a problem, since esptool is always a sender of udp messages, never a reciever. So it's ok if the listening udp socket doesn't send any messages to it. Moreover, any other udp connectors, such as the wifi-uart remote, will always connect sufficiently in advance before any udp communication is necessary, giving it ample time to send out special ping packets, ffrom which the listening/bound udp socket updates its remote port variable (for later sends). However, any pings sent immediately upon connection, might be missed by the listener. This isn't an issue if continuously pinging, otherwise a minimum wait period between tcp connect and udp ping is necessary. This can also perhaps be programmed into esptool.
